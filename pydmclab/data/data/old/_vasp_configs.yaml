# VASPSetUp (general)
# these should get passed through LaunchTools
standard: dmc # make mp if comparing to MP data
mag:  # **change** as desired
magmom: # you will need to pass this for AFM calcs {'magmom' : [list of magmoms (float)]}

# these should get passed through SubmitTools
xc_to_run:  # gga, ggau, or metagga
calc_to_run: # usually this is what we want unless you want an independent "static" or "loose" calc

functional: # usually this is fine

perturb_struc: False # if float, perturb internal ionic coordinates by perturb_struc
generate_bandstructure: False # if True, run a bandstructure calculation at the end
bs_symprec: 0.1 # symprec for generating primitive cell for bs calculation
bs_line_density: 20 # kpoint line density for bs calculation

# some output files
fvaspout: vasp.o # where vasp output goes in calc_dir for each vasp run
fvasperrors: errors.o # where vasp errors go in calc_dir for each vasp run

# may be desirable to pass various configs for each type of calculation
# INCARs should be {INCAR_FLAG : value}
# KPOINTs should be Kpoints object
# POTCARs should be {el (str) : potcar flag (str)}

# revised modifications
incar_mods: {} # {'gga-relax' : {'ISIF' : 2}}
kpoints_mods: {} # {'gga-relax' : {'grid' : [2,2,2]}}; {'xc-calc' : {'length' : 25}}
potcar_mods: {} # {'gga-relax' : {'W' : 'W_sv'}}

# rarely need to change these:
mag_override: False # if True, allows user to run nm calcs for mag systems and vice versa
potcar_functional:  # probably don't change
validate_magmom:  # probably don't change

# how fine of a LOBSTER DOS do you want (more = more detailed)
