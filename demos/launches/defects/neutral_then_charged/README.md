The purpose of this demo is to show how to run neutral then charged defect calculations.

First, we're going to generate structures w/ neutral defects and launch those from: `neutral/scripts/launcher.py`

Once those have started running (generated an `OUTCAR`), we can generate structures (and INCARs) with charged defects and launch those from: `charged/scripts/launcher.py`
